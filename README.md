# Most Common JSON Deserialization Needs And Solutions With Jackson

It's a repository created to demonstrate how to solve some problems described below by using Jackson library.

* Deserializing of a JSON to a mutable object.
* Deserializing of a JSON to an immutable object.
*  Deserializing of a JSON to an immutable object that is generated by Lombok
* Deserializing of a JSON with snake_case properties to an immutable object with camelCase properties
* Deserializing of a JSON object with complex data structure into an immutable object by transforming the data (Ex: deserializing a property from a nested object property to a root-level property in the target object)
* Deserializing of a JSON object with some extra fields to an immutable object.
